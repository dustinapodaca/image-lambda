# Project: AWS: S3 and Lambda
### Author: Dustin Apodaca
---
## Problem Domain

- AWS Lambda allows writing code that is triggered in the cloud, without thinking about maintaining servers. Use it to automatically run some processing on image files after theyâ€™re uploaded to an S3 Bucket.
  - Lambda function code found [here](./lamdaFunctionExample/index.js).

## Processes

### Process for AWS S3 Bucket Deployment and Lambda Function Trigger Creation

Link to [S3 Bucket JSON Object File](https://bucketdust.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.json).

- Create an AWS S3 Bucket
  - [AWS S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)
- Create an AWS Lambda Function
  - [AWS Lambda](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home)
  - [Lambda Function Code](./lamdaFunctionExample/index.js)
- Create an AWS IAM Role

- Create an AWS S3 Bucket Event Trigger
  - An event trigger is a rule that defines an event in which the Lambda function is triggered.
  - S3 trigger created that retrieves metadata for the object that has been updated.

- Upload a JSON file to the AWS S3 Bucket
  - [AWS S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)

- Verify that the Lambda function has been triggered
